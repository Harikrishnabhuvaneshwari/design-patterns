Adapter Pattern
“Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that
couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.”

Adapter Pattern: Introduction
We use adapters in our daily lives.
The moment you plug in your mobile handset or your laptop to a socket for charging, an adapter is at work.
What the adapter does is makes the socket that produces 120 V (or 220 V for European standard)
and the mobile device that requires 4 V work together.
Similarly, by using the adapter pattern in the programming world, you can make incompatible interfaces work together.


The adapter pattern is one of the classic Gang of Four structural patterns –
A set of patterns whose objective is to identify how to realize relationships between classes and objects in a simple way.
This pattern is typically used when an incompatible module needs to be integrated with an existing module without making
any source code modifications.
